APLN 000/5332 - Intercultural Communication (3 cr.)

Prerequisites
APLN 5100.

Description
This course will raise language professionals’ awareness of their own cultural assumptions, sensitize them to the multiplicity of other world views, and equip them with the means to assess and respond to their students’ cultural orientation. The course includes theoretical readings, analysis of critical incidents, values clarification, and experiential intercultural activities and field observations leading to an ethnography of communication which analyzes a given speech community’s communicative norms. The course has four main areas of concentration: a theoretically-grounded conceptualization of intercultural communication, an overview of variations in pedagogical traditions across cultures and ways these can affect language learning effectiveness, a practical component focusing on developing teachers’ own intercultural communicative competence, and a methodological component which explores ways of promoting intercultural communicative competence among language learners.
Among the concepts covered are macro-level cultural dimensions, cultures within cultures, cross-cultural variability in relationships, transmitting and interpreting verbal and non-verbal messages, managing conflict and face threats, intergroup attitudes, identity negotiation, acculturation, assimilation and ethical considerations in intercultural communication.

ARIC 000/5103 - Source - Criticism and Classical Arabic Literature (3 cr.)

Prerequisites
ARIC 2101 or instructor’s approval

Description
Source - Criticism is one of the most important philological skills at a scholar’s disposal and it is fundamental to the discipline of history. It is also a critic skill for the student of pre-modern literature as it is a key source of paratextual information and not only an exercise in positivism. This course applies the idea of taphonomy (the study of fossilization processes) to literary and histological works in Classical Arabic recorded in the tadwin period. Rather than seek to legitimize or delegitimize a given text based on its historical authenticity or provenance, this course demonstrates how to integrate the dimensions of a text’s transmission and its context into the study of literary material. Students will be introduced to the university’s manuscript holdings and will each present an unedited literary text of their choosing to the class. Students will edit a portion of these MSS and analyze these texts in their final paper.

ARIC 000/5130 - Poetry for Historians (3 cr.)

Prerequisites
ARIC 2101 or instructor’s approval

Description
This course is deigned to give historians the tools and background they need in order to use classical Arabic poetic material for their research. To the uninitiated, classical Arabic poetry can seem recondite, vague, or inconsequential and accordingly some students of pre-modern Arabo-Islamic history often prefer to bypass the poetic material they encounter in their research. By doing so, however, researchers risk ignoring a valuable source of historical information, especially regarding the affective dimensions of cultural, social, and political history. This course will train students to read classical Arabic poetry, to decipher its occasionally difficult syntax and figurative codes, and to relate poems to the contexts in which they appear. We will pay special attention to how poetry is deployed in historiographical works  and how it relates to the context in which it is presented. The course will cover subjects that should be of interest to historians:politics, war, death, memory, elites and non-elites, gender and sexuality, and modernity.

ECNG 661/6211 - Nanoscale CMOS (3 cr.)

Description
The increasing complexity of nanoscale CMOS technology imposes important constraints on the design of analog integrated circuits: while circuit performance using downscaled CMOS is largely improved in terms of speed, other analog figures of merit, such as transistor gain, are degraded. Reduced voltage headroom often requires the adoption of ultra-low-voltage techniques particularly in moderate inversion. Furthermore, variability is an important bottleneck impairing design in scaled technologies. The course covers issues ranging from technology and compact modeling aspects, to analog circuit design retargeting and methodologies for variability reduction using digital tuning, and optimization aspects on the system level.

GHHE 000/5180 - Experimental Design and Research Methods (3 cr.)

Description
Qualitative research has a long history in the social sciences. Its roots can be traced to anthropology, philosophy and sociology and its use as a method of inquiry goes back to the early decades of the twentieth century. Qualitative approaches are becoming part of alternative forms of research in medicine as practitioners look at the complex health issues that are often confronted. Qualitative research tends to seek answers to problems about which little is known and its aim is to elicit explanations from the “patient’s point of view”; thus seeking the meaning or the experience of the individual. In other words, qualitative methods enable researchers to access areas of inquiry not typically amenable to quantitative research. In contrast, the use of “objective” measures based on diagnostic criteria, whether physiologically or laboratory-based often rely on numbers, but cannot be completely removed from qualitative aspects of a diagnosis. The aim of this course is to introduce some of the qualitative and quantitative research methods currently used in health care research and to explore how they can be appropriately and fruitfully employed.

GHHE 000/5190 - Diseases and Social Perception (3 cr.)

Description
Diseases have meanings and those meanings translate into the way in which sufferers and society perceive and engage with their disease. Discourse on disease is often most charged when the disease in question threatens to cross borders, socioeconomic, national, or otherwise and, in these instances, the media is often complicit with “othering” the disease in a way that may have very real, material consequences. Examples from recent media coverage that have “otherized” the etiology of diseases, whether the disease covered is SARS as an Asian disease, the swine flu as a Mexican disease, Tuberculosis as an immigrant disease, or HIV/AIDs as a Haitian disease. In addition, effective therapy and support is often hampered by how social perception stigmatizes diseases such as mental illness, autism, Down syndrome and the like. This is no less so in the case of the sufferer’s self-image: when a woman undergoes a radical mastectomy, or when one is the victim of a disfiguring accident. The outcome, in terms of disease management and resources, is further influenced by the media’s shaping of society’s perception of the “disease of the day” through language. Through a look at several case studies and current literature, this course will focus on the ways in which disease takes on meaning and, in many cases, emerges as a signifier for something altogether different.

GHHE 000/5349 - Neurotoxicology (3 cr.)

Description
The nervous system has unique vulnerabilities to insult from a wide variety of etiological factors. Recently, there is a recognition that many neurodegenerative and neurological disorders may be due to a combination of risk factors and gene-environmental interactions. The unique vulnerabilities are compounded by the heterogeneousity of cellular substrates, regional specialization, a wide host of neurotransmitters and autocoid influences, as well as the influence of age, regenerative capacities, and social stressors. This interplay between chemical environment, stress, genes and cellular characteristics is approached at the molecular, and functional level, with particular attention to early detection and diagnostics.

GHHE 000/5351 - Environmental Health and Sustainability in the Context of Human Geography (3 cr.)

Description
The course introduces students to the nature of human geography as an academic discipline and as a body of useful knowledge through a survey of some of the field’s central challenges, concepts, methods and applications. Human geography enables us to reflect upon some of the important issues in contemporary society including: cultural diversity, environmental degradation, ethnic conflicts, globalization, poverty, racism, religious differences, overpopulation, transportation ills and urban sprawl. This provides a critical interpretation of the human inhabitation of the earth and the differences between, and the similarities amongst, people and the places and landscapes they create. By examining the cultural, economic, historical and social processes that create the spatial patterns and spatial relationships that modify the natural and built environments, one appreciates the challenges and maps a course towards remediation and solutions.

Description
This course will explore the complexities of violent conflicts on the African continent in the past 125 years. As violence, conflicts and wars seem to be crucial elements of Africa’s modern history; students will for example investigate if this means that Africans are inherently more violent than the rest of the world - or if such an assumption only disguises the complex historical roots of war and conflicts? Moreover, students will also discover that Africans have historically resisted violence and oppression just as often as they have promoted it. Students can expect to engage with a variety of interdisciplinary material and will be introduced to different African regions to get a deeper understanding of contexts of violence in Africa’s past and present. By the end of the course students will be able to critically analyze common narratives about “the violent continent” reproduced by mass media.

Prerequisites
LAW 5209 and LAW 5210  . (Prerequisites can be waived by permission of the department).

Description
What does it mean to study human rights in the Middle East today? While exploring human rights violations in the Middle East might seem like a natural starting point, this course moves beyond that exercise. It aims at disrupting the traditional divisions and binaries of ‘economic and social rights’ versus ‘civil and political rights’. It engages with human rights as a series of intersectional moves that, together, fundamentally shape life in the Middle East. Additionally, the purpose of the course is not only to study structures of domination, such as authoritarianism, Islamism, patriarchy and neoliberalism, but also to engage with spaces of resistance and struggle. Whether it is the Arab revolutions, the recent protests in Iran, or the struggles of the Kurds across the region, the people of the Middle East have been engaging in different forms of resistance that fundamentally transformed the region over the course of the past decades. Normally offered in the spring semester

An overview of the contribution of the African continent to human rights law. The course will cover the specificities of Africa from the perspective of the development, interpretation, and enforcement of international human rights law from four perspectives: (1) the development and contributions of the African regional system of human rights, (2) the treatment of human rights issues in Africa by the universal system of human rights, (3) the place and application of human rights standards in selected African countries, and (4) the application of international humanitarian law in contemporary African conflict situations. As an advanced course dealing with the role of regional approaches and issues in the contemporary history of international human rights law, the substantive focus will be on the relevance of cultural and political specificity to human rights when seen from the perspective of the varied social contexts of the African continent. In light of the rich complexity of the African social, cultural and political background, some attention will be given to the particular situation of certain African States in the development of African human rights law, such as Egypt, Nigeria or South Africa. This course is offered at irregular intervals. Please contact the Department of Law for information about its availability.

LAW 000/5221 - Law and Patriarchy (3 cr.)

Description
What does it mean to look at law from a feminist perspective? How can a critical reading of patriarchal society inform our legal analysis and our uses of the law? This course explores how structures of domination - capitalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy - have been historically codependent through systems of law and governance. It also explores how feminist movements have critically navigated around and against these structures of domination through law, and other means. Gender justice has been at the core of international human rights law and practice in the Global South. This course makes explicit broader theoretical questions about the relationship between law and patriarchy through classic texts on feminism, transfeminism, queer theory, critical race feminism, and masculinity studies, among other approaches. It engages with various themes that initially developed from outside of the academy, such as intersectionality, and capitalism’s reliance on unpaid housework, cohering feminist movements as spaces of knowledge-production, and for the articulation of feminist methodology. The course therefore focuses on how feminist methodology can reveal the distributional effects of legal outcomes, break gender binaries, and complicate North-South dichotomies.

MRS 501/5103 - International Migration and Development (3 cr.)

Description
The course provides an overview of recent literature and debates concerned with the relationships between migration and development.  Migration and development are related issues.  On the one hand, development is a determinant of migration.  International differentials in development, mainly economic (labor-, income- and capital-related), but also political (state- and society-related), will be reviewed.  These elements apply at the sending end as push factors (underemployment and unemployment; poverty; poor access to welfare; low rewards to skills; poor governance, political or civil instability, etc.) and at the receiving end as pull factors (jobs availability; higher incomes; social security; higher education; networks of previous migrants; etc.).  On the other hand, migration has an impact on development.  International mobility of workers and their family members can work for, or against, development.  Debates on the impact of development include the following:
Destination Countries:
Considering whether migrant workers compete with or complement local labor?  Do they reduce or increase average incomes/wages?  Contribute to or drain host country welfare services?
Origin Countries:
While migrant remittances provide for better housing, education and health of families left behind, their impact on the local and national economy is much debated.  Do they boost production or imports?  Do they create employment or deter entry into the local labour market?  Do they lead to sustainable patterns of development?  Do they further the access to credit of local communities and migrants themselves?  To what extent do migrants establish businesses as a result of their earnings abroad?  To what extent do governments foster development along with migrant communities and host countries with migration-induced development through confidence building, infrastructure and skills training?  Under what conditions does migration of skills result in a brain drain or a brain gain for sending countries?  In both sending and receiving countries, different patterns of migration: circular, return, temporary, permanent, regular/irregular may have different impacts on development.

Description
Philosophies of History offer a broad range of reflections on the historic dimension of our existence, i.e. on the fact that we understand ourselves in a temporal horizon of being-with-others. These reflections might prompt us to reflect on the genesis of notions such as ‘universal history’ or ‘progress’, or they might aim at clarifying what we mean when we ascribe causality to individuals, groups or any other kind of ‘historical force’. Finally, we might even feel the need to analyze and evaluate which ways of conceiving of a maximal horizon of action are rationally justifiable in the situation we find ourselves in.

PHIL 500/5101 - Advanced Seminar in Classical Philosophy (3 cr.)

Description
This course will deal with issues in Ancient Greek and Medieval Philosophy that are relevant for an appreciation of Egypt’s philosophical tradition, as well as for an understanding of the philosophical debates that contributed to the development of Islamic Philosophy. Special emphasis will accordingly be placed upon the following: Some of the great philosophers who lived and worked in Egypt (such as Philo Judaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen and Moses Maimonides); the history of Platonism (Plato, Plotinus and the Ancient commentators on Plato and Aristotle working in the schools of Athens and Alexandria); and the Aristotelian tradition (Aristotle, Alexander of Aphrodisias and Themistius).


NEWLINE
PHIL 000/5104 - Selected Topics in Contemporary Philosophy (3 cr.)

Description
Contemporary philosophy is pluralistic. This trait expresses itself in different conceptions of the task of philosophy and its methods. The motives of this pluralism often reflect differing - scientistic, liberalistic, modernist, posthumanist - attitudes towards the unprecedented dynamics with which historical processes originating in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries are seen to continue to determine our articulation of the human condition. Along these lines this course explores thematic strands which are constitutive of both the unity in the questioning outlook and the plurality of the answers proposed in contemporary philosophy. Such explorations might concern the discourse on language as an unsurmountable horizon of our capacity to understand (Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Davidson, Derrida); they might delineate different conceptions of the status and role of philosophy vis-à-vis the natural sciences as developed in the analytic, neo-Kantian, pragmatic or phenomenological-hermeneutic tradition; finally such explorations could aim at a comparison of the various incarnations of the contemporary interest in the concepts of praxis and agency, which animates the discourse no less in critical theory and post-structuralism than it does in analytical theories of action and neo-pragmatist accounts of the grounding of sapience and agency in discursive practices.

PHIL 360/5117 - Philosophy of Language (3 cr.)

Description
Although the emphasis on the importance of a systematic philosophical reflection of language is a characteristic feature of its development in the 20th century which, thus, has been described as taking a ‘linguistic turn’, the philosophical interest in language is, nonetheless, almost coeval with the ancient origins of the discipline. As a result of this perennial interest, philosophers have studied various dimensions of language and the ways in which it is constitutive of the way we conceive of ourselves, relate to the world, establish and preserve political communities and partake in a shared historical world of meanings and linguistic practices. This course, consequently, aims at a both historically and systematically informed exploration of these dimensions of language in its philosophical reflection.

PHIL 000/5121 - Philosophical Logic (3 cr.)

Description
Speaking of logic, we do not only mean that science which analyzes the components, forms and grounds of the soundness of reasoning; we do also refer to a human capacity that comes into play whenever we defend our claims and attack those of others. Logic, thus, is both: a theory that can be studied and a know-how, governing our practices of argumentation. With that in mind, philosophers are expected to cultivate their abilities to analyze and critically assess the logical structures of philosophical arguments. This course, therefore, offers an introduction to syllogistic and symbolic logic with a focus on the argumentative exigencies of the discipline.

PHIL 000/5130 - Philosophy of Mind (3 cr.)

Description
This course is an introduction to the philosophy of mind. Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that deals with the analysis and resolution of conceptual questions concerning the nature of the mind. Research in the philosophy of mind tackles such questions as: What is a mind? What is consciousness? Is a person’s mind a distinct thing from her body? Could a sufficiently complicated artificial neural network or robot be a conscious agent, in the fullest possible sense? Questions such as these clearly straddle a boundary between conceptual analysis and empirical science. Therefore, philosophy of mind is an interdisciplinary subject, which draws on cutting-edge research from a diverse range of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, and computer science

Prerequisites
PHYS 2211 and PHYS 4231  or equivalent.

Description
This is a course about how charge flows in semiconductors with an emphasis on transport in nanoscale devices. The course consists of three main parts. Part 1 focuses on near- equilibrium transport in the presence of small gradients in the electrochemical potential or temperature, with or without the application of a small magnetic field. The emphasis in Part 2 is on the physics of carrier scattering and how the microscopic scattering processes are related to macroscopic relaxation times and mean-free-paths. Part 3 examines high-field transport in bulk semiconductors and so-called “non-local” transport in sub-micron devices. The course concludes with a brief introduction to quantum transport. The objective of the course is to develop a broad understanding of the basic concepts needed to understand modern
electronic devices. It is intended for those who work on electronic devices - whether they are experimentalists, device theorists, or computationalists.

GREN 000/5236 - International Migration and Development (3 cr.)

Prerequisites
The course provides an overview of recent literature and debates concerned with the relationships between migration and development. Migration and development are related issues. On the one hand, development is a determinant of migration. International differentials in development, mainly economic (labor-, income- and capital-related), but also political (state- and society-related), will be reviewed. These elements apply at the sending end as push factors (underemployment and unemployment; poverty; poor access to welfare; low rewards to skills; poor governance, political or civil instability, etc.) and at the receiving end as pull factors (jobs availability; higher incomes; social security; higher education; networks of previous migrants; etc.). On the other hand, migration has an impact on development. International mobility of workers and their family members can work for, or against, development. Debates on the impact of development include the following:

Destination Countries:
Considering whether migrant workers compete with or complement local labor? Do they reduce or increase average incomes/wages? Contribute to or drain host country welfare services?
Origin Countries:
While migrant remittances provide for better housing, education and health of families left behind, their impact on the local and national economy is much debated. Do they boost production or imports? Do they create employment or deter entry into the local labour market? Do they lead to sustainable patterns of development? Do they further the access to credit of local communities and migrants themselves? To what extent do migrants establish businesses as a result of their earnings abroad? To what extent do governments foster development along with migrant communities and host countries with migration-induced development through confidence building, infrastructure and skills training? Under what conditions does migration of skills result in a brain drain or a brain gain for sending countries? In both sending and receiving countries, different patterns of migration: circular, return, temporary, permanent, regular/irregular may have different impacts on development.
